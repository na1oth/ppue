General Usage instructions
- The data files are updated to match the latest "errata" at this time (2.1).
- Abilities and Talents are forced to be within the default package ("none") and Trait Cap, defaulting from 1d - 12d for 18 pts. 
- You can pick an image to use by clicking on the default image and picking an image file. 
	- It does not store the actual image (currently).  It stores the filename so if you move that image, you'll cause an issue on reload. 
- Powers, Flaws, Perks, and Gear have a dropdown combomenu to add additional abilities.
- The hero point cost of an ability is shows in brackets ([]).  If it has a ^, the cost is per level, otherwise it's a flat add.
- The ^ may be a strange choice per level, but / wasn't as easy to pick out.  I'm open to suggestions.
- The * denotes an ability that involves (adds/costs) Resolve.
- The red X removes that ability
- To edit an ability (including adding levels), you need to single or double click on it.
- The edit dialog shows the final version that will go on your character sheet at the top.
- The edit dialog has a "Notes" line to add short comments to the end of a trait. 
- The edit dialog only shows level for leveled abilities
- The edit dialog Source defaults to Super for powers, but can be changed to the list of defaults in the book.
- The edit dialog Pick Pros/Cons is a dropdown to add modifiers.
- The edit dialog modifier list box has edit, delete (red X), and up/down arrows for rearranging the list.
- The modifier list up/down arrows work visually, but do not trigger an update to the character sheet until you do an edit or delete. (bug)
- The edit dialog "Done" will exit the window.  There is no backout - any change made in this window takes effect as you do it.
- The list of Pros/Cons will show power specific modifiers first, then the general list. I had to rename a few to make every key unique. 
- I've added any custom abilities I allow at the end of each selection list.  It's usually fairly obvious since it breaks the sorting patterns. 

Notes on how to do specific things:
- Boost is treated as a "Pro/Con" worth 0 points.  Pick a second copy of the power you want to boost.
   - Powers with boost will not validate the level cap correction since they start from level 1 instead of the existing power level.
   - There are power entries for (Super) Abilities (Attributes), so you can assign modifiers like Boost that are based on the existing attribute.
- Overkill can be applied to Super Might, which has a base value of Might.
- For Energy Aborption, Kinetic is a Pro that needs to be taken first to make the cost 3/lvl. 
- OmniPower defaults to "Narrow". Broad as well as the specific examples are treated as a Pro. You can use editing to consolidate as desired.
- I divided Super Senses into "Acute Sense" which is based on Perception and leveled, and "Super Senses".
- Super Senses doesn't add any senses.  Each Super Sense is actually listed as an Pro option for the ability.  The benefit of this approach is that 
	your Super Senses are on one line and don't clutter up the list of powers. 
- I moved Specialities to Perks, since they don't get modifiers and Perks is a much shorter list to sort through.
- You can add additional, custom modifiers using the button beside delete in the modifier list. 
- You can modify everything in the Pro/Con listbox by highlighting and cicking again or on the edit button at the top of the window.
	- This feature is to specify types, clean up extra text, or just make it look better. 
	- You can modify the point value in the brackets [], but generally should not as the program calculates values using these numbers.
	- Where it says "Pick" you're intended to modify that to be the value.  It's a reminder to customize as required.
- For non-combat equipment, I created a generic "Equipment" tag.  You can customize the "Specify Type" or add another custom modifier.

Here's a list of things the program does not do or that I'd like to eventually add. 
- I haven't implemented any level cap exceptions (such as recommended for Overkill).  
- Store the image as data rather than keeping it as a separate file. 
- Implement the new Martial Arts Pro from the FAQ 
- I haven't added any support for building HQs or Vehicles.  Sidekicks, pets, and other things can be built as separate characters.:w
- Show the highest attribute replacement available
- Set base power rank abilities from other powers
- Jump w/typing - yea, the combo lists are long
- Category filtering - yea, the combo lists are long
- Print PDF (on my list to add)

Bugs
- The modifier list doesn't validate to see if that modifier should be applied to that ability. 
- The modifier list up/down arrows work visually, but do not trigger an update to the character sheet until you do an edit or delete.
- Created modifiers aren't being added unless you do an edit or delete afterwards
